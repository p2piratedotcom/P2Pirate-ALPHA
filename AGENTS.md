# Repository Guidelines for Agents

This repository is a Flutter project. The environment has all Dart and Flutter dependencies pre-fetched during setup, but network access is disabled afterwards. Use the commands below to work with the project.

## Setup

```bash
flutter pub get --enforce-lockfile
```

If the above fails due to the offline environment, add the `--offline` flag.

## Static Analysis and Formatting

Run analysis and formatting (only on changed files) before committing code:

```bash
flutter analyze

dart format [files]

```

## Running Tests

Run `flutter test test_units` for all unit and widget tests. The older
`flutter test test_units/main.dart` aggregate is also supported. For the safe
Linux UI smoke test, run `dart run_integration_tests.dart` with Xvfb installed.
It uses disposable directories and does not start KDF. For an isolated KDF
process test, set `P2PIRATE_KDF_PATH` to the reviewed KDF 2.7 executable and
run `dart run_integration_tests.dart --kdf`. This opts into a separate random
loopback RPC port and creates only a disposable test wallet and keyring. See
`docs/INTEGRATION_TESTING.md` for scope and `docs/TEST_STATUS.md` for the
verified baseline. Do not run the older browser wallet tests against a live
wallet; they still require disposable fixtures and desktop adaptation.

## Additional Documentation

### Code Styles/Standards

Ensure you follow the existing architecture and style of the codebase. The codebase uses BLoC where applicable and follows general OOP/SOLID coding guidelines. Familiarise yourself with the BLoC conventions and Conventional Commits standards included at the end of this document.

### Cheetahdex Wallet

This section is only relevant if you are working in the `cheetahdex-wallet-web` repository:

Detailed instructions for building and running the app can be found in `docs/BUILD_RUN_APP.md` and other files in the `docs/` directory. See `README.md` for an overview of available documentation.

The majority of the crypto/API-related operations are abstracted out to the `komodo_defi_sdk` and its associated packages e.g. `komodo_defi_types`.

# Komodo DeFi Flutter SDK

This section is only relevant if you are working in the `komodo-defi-sdk-flutter` repository:

The repository consists of a suite of packages (in the `packages` directory) which make up a Flutter SDK package `komodo_defi_sdk` used for implementing Komodo DeFi into Flutter apps.

The KDF API documentation can be found in the root folder at `/KDF_API_DOCUMENTATION.md`. For any features involving RPC requests, ensure you reference and understand all applicable RPCs, data structure and general notes needed to implement the feature in the SDK.

## PR Guidance

Commit messages should be clear and descriptive. When opening a pull request, summarize the purpose of the change and reference related issues when appropriate. Ensure commit messages and PR title follow the Conventional Commits standard as described in the standards section below.
